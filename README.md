Ubiqua Services API Postman Collection
======================================

*This repository contains a [Postman][postman] collection describing the
features that [Ubiqua][ubiqua] provides through its [Services API][ubiqua-api].*

## How to use

Install Postman, then import this collection using the following URL:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubilogix/ubiqua-postman/master/ubiqua.json
```

The request templates in the collection are grouped by resource; all examples
assume that Ubiqua is listening on port `19501` on the local system.

Please see the [Ubiqua Service API documentation][ubiqua-api] for instructions
on how to enable this feature.
